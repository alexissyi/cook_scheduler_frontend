When a user enters the app, they should initially see a login and registration page. After logging in and registering, they should then enter the calendar page. In the nav bar, they should see navigation links for the availability and preference pages, as well as an option to logout. If they click the logout link, they should be redirected to the login and registration page. If they click the preference link, they should see a preference form for the current period, populated with their previous answers. If they click the availability link, they should see a similar calendar grid to the calendar page, but with their availability for the current period.
